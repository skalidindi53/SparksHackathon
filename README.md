# SparksHackathon
This webstite is made for the SparksHackathon at UIC. We used HTML, CSS, javascript and maps API to create this website called "WENDOR".
This website showcases the vending machines and water fountains on campus using google maps with custom markers. We plan to improve The website by allowing users to add additonal vending machines and water fountains to the map. Later we plan to add a feature that allows users to add reviews and ratings to the vending machines and water fountains. The service brings the community together by collaborative responses and reviews which help us to distinguish which vending machines require repairing and upgrades. This is done by the community for the community.
